# Evaluating Teen Pregnancy Risk Factors and Prevention Policy in Baltimore, MD.
## Executive Summary
A wealth of scientific literature demonstrates how teenage pregnancy can [stifle a woman's educational attainment and professional opportunities](https://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/jesr/article/viewFile/542/567). Teenage pregnancy is [especially prominent in Baltimore, MD](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170), where a high teen birth rate disproportionately affects the city's black and low income residents. Our data analysis sought to determine the factors that influence teenage birth rates throughout the city and provide policy makers with strategies to decrease teen pregnancies and ultimately promote a more equitable environment. Our findings suggest that access to prenatal care and protection of minors against domestic violence are the greatest factors in reducing the teenage birth rate among black, low-income Baltimoreans. We therefore suggest that policy-makers increase funding for prenatal care facilities and domestic violence shelters in specific areas of the city, and reform police procedures for domestic violence in order to place minors in more frequent contact with social and healthcare workers. 

## The Challenge of Teenage Pregnancy 
### Business Question
What are the risk factors of teenage pregnancy in Baltimore, and how can the city's government mitigate these factors and lower its teenage birth rate?

### Why Teenage Pregnancy Policy is Important
[Over 67% of teenage mothers](https://sedl.org/txcc/resources/briefs/number5/bp_childcare.pdf) in the U.S. graduate high school. High school graduates [earn around 40% more than their peers who dropped out](https://sedl.org/txcc/resources/briefs/number5/bp_childcare.pdf). These two statistics illustrate how teenage pregnancy can reinforce gender inequality by depriving women of education and income. Furthermore, [CDC research](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/social-determinants-disparities-teen-pregnancy.htm) has established that racial and socioeconomic disparities contribute to teen pregnancy rates. In effect, teenage pregnancy creates a self-perpetuating cycle of poverty for women, low-income individuals, and racial minorities in America. As Baltimore is one of America's [most socioeconomically unequal cities](https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/beyond-baltimore-thoughts-on-place-race-and-opportunity/), it is imperative that its government addresses the issue of teenage pregnancy. If the city continues its current trend of high teenage birth rates, it risks deepening its highly racialized poverty and, by consequence, inhibiting its citizens' economic opportunities and quality of life. 

## Our Solution
### Data Questions and Sources 
Using [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) data on the relationship between income and race ditribution in Baltimore, the demographic with the highest teen pregnancy rate was low-income, Black populations in neighborhoods within the "Black Butterfly," the eastern and western regions of the city with high precentages of Black residents and low economic growth.
