## Evaluating Teen Pregnancy Risk Factors and Prevention Policy in Baltimore, MD.
Previous [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/social-determinants-disparities-teen-pregnancy.htm) research has established that racial and socioeconomic disparities contribute to teen pregnancy rates; higher teen pregnancy rates are observed in BIPOC and low-income populations. The same trend holds true for the city of Baltimore: the city's highest rates are in low-income, Black populations and lowest rates in high-income, White populations.
